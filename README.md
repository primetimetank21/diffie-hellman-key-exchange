# Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange

## Purpose of this Repository
This repo goes alongside Homework Assignment 2, Question 3. The question reads as follows:
<br/> 
*Write a program by implementing Diffieâ€“Hellman key exchange and show that the algorithm generates the same key/result at both ends.*

## Important Note
No encryption has been implemented for a simple, straightforward answer to the question. This is just a basic example of the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange. In a real implementation, encryption can help improve the overall security.
